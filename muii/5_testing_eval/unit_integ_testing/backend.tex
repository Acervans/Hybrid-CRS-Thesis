The backend's business logic, which encompasses data processing, recommendation generation, and conversational state management, was thoroughly evaluated with unit tests to ensure its reliability.

The data processing pipeline, implemented in \texttt{data\_utils.py}, was validated through \\ \texttt{test\_data\_utils.py}. These tests confirm the correctness of the \acs{llm}-based inference for identifying column roles and data types, ensuring the automated data preparation is robust.

The core recommendation logic was tested in \texttt{test\_falkordb\_recommender.py}. Using a \texttt{pytest} fixture, a temporary mock dataset is created to test the \texttt{FalkorDBRecommender} class. The test suite validates the entire lifecycle, including data ingestion, graph creation, and the output of the different recommendation methods (context-aware, collaborative filtering, and hybrid recommendations), and the generation of explanations.

Finally, the stateful components of the conversational workflow were validated. The \\ \texttt{test\_user\_profile.py} script tests the \texttt{UserProfile} class for managing user preferences mid-conversation, while \texttt{test\_falkordb\_chat\_history.py} ensures the reliable persistence of conversation logs in the graph database.
