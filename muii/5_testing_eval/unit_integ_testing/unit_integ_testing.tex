To ensure the correctness and reliability of the platform's codebase, the testing strategy incorporated both \textbf{unit tests} and \textbf{integration tests}. This approach validates the system at different levels: verifying individual components in isolation and ensuring that these components interact correctly as a cohesive whole. All tests were developed and executed using the \texttt{pytest} framework and are organized in a dedicated \texttt{/tests} directory for maintainability.

Unit tests were written for discrete functions and classes, often using mocking to isolate the component under test from its external dependencies. Integration tests, on the other hand, were designed to validate the interactions between different modules, such as testing an \acs{api} endpoint's complete logic flow or the interaction between the recommender class and the graph database.
