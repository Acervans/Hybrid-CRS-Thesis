All performance, unit and integration tests were conducted on a single machine with the following hardware specifications, representing a typical modern developer-grade laptop:
\begin{compactitem}[\textbullet]
    \item \textbf{\acs{cpu}:} Intel® Core™ i7-11800H @ 2.30 GHz (16 Cores)
    \item \textbf{\acs{ram}:} 16 GB DDR4 @ 3200MHz
    \item \textbf{\acs{gpu}:} NVIDIA® GeForce® RTX 3050 Laptop \acs{gpu} with 4GB VRAM
\end{compactitem}

The software environment was managed entirely through Docker Compose. For the duration of the performance tests, the FastAPI backend was configured to run with 4 Uvicorn workers to make better use of the available \acs{cpu} cores. 
It is important to note that for production use, the backend is limited to a single worker due to the in-memory dictionary used to manage active conversational workflows. The testing environment also included the containerized Ollama and FalkorDB services.
