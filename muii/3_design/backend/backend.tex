The backend serves as the central backbone of the platform. It is designed as a stateless, high-performance \acs{api} gateway using the FastAPI framework. Its primary role is to process incoming requests from the frontend, orchestrate the necessary domain logic by communicating with various downstream services, and return responses to the client. The design prioritizes a clean separation of concerns, dividing the complex logic into distinct, maintainable modules. This section details this modular structure, models key interactions with sequence diagrams, defines the database schema for metadata storage, and illustrates the primary data flows within the system.
