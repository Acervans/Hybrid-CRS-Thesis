This chapter transitions from foundational concepts to the specific design of the proposed platform. It serves as the architectural blueprint for the project, detailing the methodologies and patterns used to construct a scalable and maintainable system. First, it begins with a thorough analysis of the system's requirements, which are categorized into functional and non-functional specifications. This analysis forms the basis for all subsequent design decisions. Following the requirements, the chapter presents a comprehensive overview of the system's architecture, including its modular design and the interactions between its various components.
