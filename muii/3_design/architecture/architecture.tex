The platform is founded on a decoupled architecture designed to promote modularity, scalability, and maintainability. This architectural style separates the system into several distinct, independently deployable components, each with a specific responsibility. This approach prevents the tight coupling of a monolithic system, allowing for greater flexibility in development, technology choice, and scaling strategies. Communication between these modules is handled through a well-defined \acs{api}, which serves as the contract between the frontend client and the backend services.
