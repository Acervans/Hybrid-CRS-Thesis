The paradigm of human-computer interaction is undergoing a significant transformation, largely driven by the advent of powerful \acp{llm}. These models have unlocked new possibilities for creating dynamic and intuitive conversational experiences. This chapter introduces a project situated at the confluence of this technological wave and the established field of \acl{rs}s \cite{BOOK:RS-HANDBOOK}. It begins by exploring the motivation behind developing a novel, scalable platform for conversational recommendations, born from the need to bridge the gap between the potential of \acp{llm} and the practical engineering challenges of their implementation. Subsequently, the specific objectives guiding this engineering effort are outlined, followed by a description of the structure of this document.
