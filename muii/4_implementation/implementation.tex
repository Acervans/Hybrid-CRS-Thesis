This chapter transitions from the abstract architectural design presented previously to the concrete implementation of the platform. It details the translation of the system's blueprints into functional code, highlighting the specific libraries, frameworks, and patterns used to build each component.

A core principle of the implementation is \textbf{modularization through containerization}. The entire platform is designed to run within Docker containers, which encapsulates each primary serviceâ€”the FastAPI backend, the Next.js frontend, the FalkorDB graph database, and the Ollama \ac{llm} server. This approach, orchestrated via Docker Compose, ensures an efficient development workflow, simplifies deployment, and guarantees portability and scalability. By isolating dependencies and standardizing the runtime environment, containerization provides a robust and reproducible foundation for the entire system.
