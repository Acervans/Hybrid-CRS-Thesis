The Next.js frontend application is deployed on Vercel \cite{NEXTJS}, a cloud platform specifically designed and optimized for hosting modern web applications and frontend frameworks. Vercel provides a seamless deployment experience by integrating directly with the project's GitHub repository.

This integration facilitates a continuous deployment workflow. Every push to the main branch of the repository automatically triggers a new deployment on Vercel. The platform handles the entire build process, including installing dependencies, running the Next.js build, and deploying the resulting static and server-rendered assets to its global edge network. This ensures that the live application is always synchronized with the latest version of the code, providing quick iteration and delivery of new features and fixes.
