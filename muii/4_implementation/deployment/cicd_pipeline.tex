The project adopts a pragmatic and differentiated approach to \acs{cicd} for the frontend and backend.

For the \textbf{frontend}, a full \acs{cicd} pipeline is implemented through its integration with Vercel. On every push to the main branch, Vercel's pipeline automatically lints, builds and deploys the application. As mentioned previously in Section~\ref{SEC:FRONTDEV}, code quality is enforced locally before commits via a Husky pre-commit hook that runs ESLint and Prettier to ensure consistent code style and linting.

For the \textbf{backend}, a decision was made not to implement a fully automated \acs{cicd} pipeline due to the overhead of configuring and maintaining such a pipeline outweighing its benefits. Instead, code quality and integration are ensured through robust pre-commit hooks. These hooks automatically format Python code with \texttt{black}, and run the entire test suite using \texttt{pytest}. This local CI process is sufficient for maintaining code quality. Furthermore, the backend's dependency on stateful services like Ollama makes automated testing in a standard CI runner environment prohibitively complex and costly.
