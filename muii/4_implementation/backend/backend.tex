The backend was implemented as a Python application using the FastAPI web framework. It serves as the central \acs{api} gateway, responsible for handling all client requests, managing the various backend services, and enforcing domain logic and authentication. The implementation closely follows the modular design outlined in the previous chapter, with a clear separation of concerns between \acs{api} routing, data processing, \ac{llm} interaction, and recommendation logic.
