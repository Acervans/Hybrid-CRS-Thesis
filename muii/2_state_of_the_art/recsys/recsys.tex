\aclp{rs} are a cornerstone of modern web platforms, designed to help users navigate vast catalogs of items by predicting their preferences and suggesting relevant content. These systems are critical for personalization and user engagement in domains ranging from e-commerce to media streaming. The underlying algorithms can be broadly categorized into several families.

The most common approaches are Content-Based Filtering, which recommends items based on their intrinsic properties, and Collaborative Filtering, which depends on the behavior of a community of users to find items a target user might like, such as ItemKNN \cite{ITEMKNN}. Many state-of-the-art systems employ hybrid methods, which combine these and other strategies to mitigate their individual weaknesses and improve recommendation quality.

This thesis does not aim to propose novel recommendation algorithms. Instead, the focus is on the engineering challenge of integrating existing, pre-trained recommender models as ``expert'' components within a larger, scalable conversational platform. To facilitate this, the project utilizes RecBole \cite{RECBOLE}, a established recommendation library which provides a unified and efficient framework for working with a wide range of recommendation algorithms. A detailed investigation of library comparison, model classification, evaluation metrics, and the specific model choices for this project are covered in the complementary research thesis \cite{MUI2ICSI-THESIS}.
