FastAPI is a modern, high-performance web framework for building \acp{api} with Python \cite{FASTAPI}. Its design philosophy prioritizes development speed and runtime performance, making it an excellent choice for services that must handle potentially high loads and complex logic.

One of the highlights of FastAPI is its automatic generation of interactive \acs{api} documentation. It depends on Python type hints and the Pydantic library to automatically validate, serialize, and deserialize data, while also creating a detailed OpenAPI (formerly Swagger) schema for the documentation. This feature proves pragmatic for development, testing, and potential integration with other services.

Furthermore, FastAPI's performance is among the best in the Python ecosystem, as it is built atop the Starlette ASGI framework \cite{STARLETTE}. This ensures that the \acs{api} can handle concurrent requests efficiently, essential for a responsive user experience, especially when mediating long-running tasks involving \ac{llm} inference or data processing. These features collectively make FastAPI an ideal choice for the robust and scalable backend required by this project.
