The development of a modern, full-stack platform requires the careful selection of web application frameworks for both the client-facing frontend and the server-side backend. These frameworks provide the foundational structure upon which the application is built, significantly influencing development velocity, performance, maintainability, and the end-user experience.

This project employs a decoupled architecture, with a distinct frontend application responsible for rendering the user interface and a separate backend \acs{api} that handles business logic, data processing, and communication with other services. This approach, illustrated in contrast to a traditional monolithic architecture in Figure~\ref{FIG:WEB_ARCH}, allows for greater flexibility and scalability. This section provides an overview of the primary frameworks chosen for this architecture: Next.js for the frontend and FastAPI for the backend. It also discusses general design principles for user interfaces in the context of \ac{llm}-powered applications.
