For the frontend component of the platform, Next.js was selected as the development framework \cite{NEXTJS}. Next.js is a production-grade React framework that provides a rich set of features designed to build fast, scalable, and user-friendly web applications. Its architecture is particularly well-suited for creating intricate, data-driven interfaces like the one required for this project.

Principal features of Next.js that motivated its selection include its flexible rendering strategies, such as Server-Side Rendering (SSR) and Static Site Generation (SSG), which enhance performance and Search Engine Optimization (SEO). The framework's file-based routing system simplifies the organization of pages and components, leading to a more intuitive development workflow. Furthermore, Next.js has first-class support for TypeScript, which enables the development of type-safe, robust, and more maintainable code. While Next.js also supports the creation of backend \acs{api} routes, this project utilizes a dedicated Python backend to better separate concerns and leverage Python's extensive data science ecosystem.
