Building robust and effective applications powered by \acp{llm} requires a strong foundation in data management and system scalability. The performance of techniques like \ac{rag} and the overall reliability of the platform are highly dependent on how data is processed, stored, and retrieved. This section reviews the essential data management practices and technologies applied in this project, covering the entire data lifecycle from initial cleaning to efficient storage in specialized databases tailored for \ac{ai} workloads.
