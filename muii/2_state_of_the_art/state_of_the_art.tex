This chapter provides a review of the key concepts, technologies, and existing research that form the foundation of this project. The aim is to establish the context in which this work is situated and to justify the technological choices made during the design and implementation phases.

This review is divided into four main areas. First, a high-level overview of \acp{llm}, the core technology enabling the conversational capabilities of the platform, is provided. Second, the field of \aclp{rs} is briefly discussed and examined from an engineering and integration perspective. Third, essential topics in data management and scalability are explored, which are critical for building a robust and efficient system. Finally, a review of the modern web application frameworks utilized to build the user-facing components of the platform is presented.
