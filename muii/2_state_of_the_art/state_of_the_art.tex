This chapter provides a review of the key concepts, technologies, and existing research that form the foundation of this project. The aim is to establish the context in which this work is situated and to justify the technological choices made during the design and implementation phases.

This review is divided into four main areas. First, we provide a high-level overview of \acp{llm}, the core technology enabling the conversational capabilities of the platform. Second, we briefly discuss the field of \acl{rs}s, which will be examined from an engineering and integration perspective. Third, we explore essential topics in data management and scalability, which are critical for building a robust and efficient system. Finally, we review the modern web application frameworks that were utilized to construct the user-facing components of the platform.
