  abstract   = {The explosive growth of the world-wide-web and the emergence of e-commerce has led to the development of recommender systems---a personalized information filtering technology used to identify a set of items that will be of interest to a certain user. User-based collaborative filtering is the most successful technology for building recommender systems to date and is extensively used in many commercial recommender systems. Unfortunately, the computational complexity of these methods grows linearly with the number of customers, which in typical commercial applications can be several millions. To address these scalability concerns model-based recommendation techniques have been developed. These techniques analyze the user--item matrix to discover relations between the different items and use these relations to compute the list of recommendations.In this article, we present one such class of model-based recommendation algorithms that first determines the similarities between the various items and then uses them to identify the set of items to be recommended. The key steps in this class of algorithms are (i) the method used to compute the similarity between the items, and (ii) the method used to combine these similarities in order to compute the similarity between a basket of items and a candidate recommender item. Our experimental evaluation on eight real datasets shows that these item-based algorithms are up to two orders of magnitude faster than the traditional user-neighborhood based recommender systems and provide recommendations with comparable or better quality.},

  abstract = {In recent years, artificial intelligence (AI) technology has been used in most if not all domains and has greatly benefited our lives. While AI can accurately extract critical features and valuable information from large amounts of data to help people complete tasks faster, there are growing concerns about the non-transparency of AI in the decision-making process. The emergence of explainable AI (XAI) has allowed humans to better understand and control AI systems, which is motivated to provide transparent explanations for the decisions made by AI. This article aims to present a comprehensive overview of recent research on XAI approaches from three well-defined taxonomies. We offer an in-depth analysis and summary of the status and prospects of XAI applications in several key areas where reliable explanations are urgently needed to avoid mistakes in decision-making. We conclude by discussing XAI’s limitations and future research directions.}
