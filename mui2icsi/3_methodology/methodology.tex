This chapter details the methodological framework designed and implemented to address the research questions outlined in the introduction. It provides a technical blueprint of the system, describing the overall architecture and the specific methods employed for conversational workflow management, user preference elicitation, hybrid recommendation, and natural language explanation generation. The methodology is presented in two main parts: first, an overview of the high-level framework and its primary components, and second, a deeper dive into the implementation of the Hybrid \acl{crs} itself.
