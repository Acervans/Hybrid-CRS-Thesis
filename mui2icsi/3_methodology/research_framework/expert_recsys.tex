To address the second part of \textbf{RQ2} regarding deeply personalized recommendations for established users, the framework integrates a pre-trained expert recommender model. This component is responsible for capturing the complex, latent patterns within the user-item interaction data.

The expert model is invoked by the conversational agent via a function call when the dialogue suggests that a more personalized set of recommendations is required. The model used is \texttt{EASER} (Embarrassingly Shallow Autoencoders for Sparse Data) \cite{EASER}, a powerful autoencoder-based algorithm known for its strong performance on sparse data. This model is trained offline on the entire interaction history for a given agent's dataset, allowing it to provide high-accuracy recommendations that complement the real-time, contextual (content-based) and \acl{cf} suggestions from the graph-based engine. The reasoning behind selecting \texttt{EASER} is explained in Subsection~\ref{SSS:MODELSELECT}
