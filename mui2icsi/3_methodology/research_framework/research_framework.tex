The research is centered on a hybrid, modular framework that integrates a conversational layer, managed by an \ac{llm}, with specialized backend modules for user profiling, recommendation, and explanation. The system is designed as an event-driven workflow orchestrated by the LlamaIndex framework. This architecture allows the \ac{llm} to act as an intelligent agent that can reason about the dialogue context and employ external, specialized tools to fulfill user requests. The following subsections detail the core components of this framework, each designed to address a specific research question.
