This section provides a detailed examination of the implemented Hybrid \acl{crs} as an \ac{llm}-based agent. It builds upon the high-level research framework by describing the concrete methods used to realize the system's core functionalities. The overall architecture is designed as a hybrid workflow that combines a real-time graph-based engine with a pre-trained expert model, coordinated by an \ac{llm}.
