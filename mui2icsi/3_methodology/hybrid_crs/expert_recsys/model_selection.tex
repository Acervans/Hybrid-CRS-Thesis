To select an appropriate expert model, preliminary tests were conducted with several candidate algorithms from the RecBole library. The evaluation was performed on the well-known \texttt{MovieLens-100k} dataset, with a focus on both recommendation accuracy and computational efficiency.

Based on these tests, the \textbf{EASER} model was selected, demonstrating the strongest performance in the preliminary evaluation by achieving high accuracy on key rank-aware metrics such as Recall@k and \acs{ndcg}@k. An additional advantage was its efficiency; the model trains quickly and the hyperparameter tuning process is streamlined, as it primarily depends on a single regularization weight parameter, \texttt{reg\_weight}. The high accuracy and efficiency made \texttt{EASER} the most suitable choice for the expert model component of the hybrid system.
