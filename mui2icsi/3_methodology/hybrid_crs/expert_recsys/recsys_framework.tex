The training, evaluation, tuning and serving of the expert model are managed using the RecBole \cite{RECBOLE} library, a comprehensive framework for building and evaluating \aclp{rs} built on the PyTorch \cite{PYTORCH} machine learning library. RecBole was chosen due to its comprehensive and unified nature as an open-source library. It provides standardized implementations for a wide array of recommendation algorithms, along with tools for data processing, hyperparameter tuning, and reproducible evaluation. This makes it a suitable framework for conducting the research and experimentation required for this thesis, ensuring that the expert model component is both powerful and built upon a solid basis.

Another option, Cornac \cite{CORNAC}, was considered, but it was ultimately not selected due to its smaller set of supported algorithms and less extensive documentation compared to RecBole. The choice of RecBole ensures that there is a generalized configuration and dataset format compatibility across the different components of the framework, allowing for better integration and maintenance.
