The advent of powerful \aclp{llm} has opened new frontiers in human-computer interaction, particularly within the domain of \aclp{rs}. Moving beyond traditional static interfaces, \acp{crs} promise a more natural and intuitive way for users to discover items that align with their preferences. This chapter lays the foundation for the research presented in this thesis. It begins by establishing the motivation for developing a novel framework for conversational recommendations, focusing on the research gaps in user profiling and explainability. Subsequently, it formulates the primary research questions that this work aims to answer and concludes by outlining the structure of the document.
