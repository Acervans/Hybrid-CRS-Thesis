This research aims to investigate a novel framework for a \ac{crs} that prioritizes user understanding and transparency. The investigation is guided by the following primary research questions:

\begin{compactenum}
    \item[\textbf{RQ1:}] To what extent can dynamic user profiles, constructed from natural language conversations, improve the quality and personalization of recommendations in a \ac{crs}?
    \item[\textbf{RQ2:}] What is an effective conversational strategy for integrating different recommendation approaches to address both cold-start and established user scenarios?
    \item[\textbf{RQ3:}] How does the integration of natural language explanations, generated from the underlying recommendation logic, influence user trust and the overall interactive experience in a \ac{crs}?
