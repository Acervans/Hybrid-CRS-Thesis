This chapter provides a research-focused review of the foundational concepts and technologies that underpin this thesis. The objective is to survey the current academic and technical landscape in order to situate the project's contributions and justify the methodological choices made. The analysis is structured into four primary domains. It begins with an in-depth look at \aclp{llm} and the main techniques used to augment their capabilities. It then reviews the field of \aclp{rs} and the specialized sub-field of \aclp{crs}. Finally, it delves into the paramount topic of explainability in recommendation, a central theme of this research.
