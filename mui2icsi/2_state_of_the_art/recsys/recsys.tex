\aclp{rs} represent a mature and fundamental field of research within information filtering. The primary goal of an \ac{rs} is to mitigate information overload by predicting a user's preference for an item and proactively suggesting relevant items from a large catalog \cite{BOOK:RS-HANDBOOK}. While conventional \acp{rs} have typically relied on a static, single-interaction paradigm, they provide the foundational predictive models upon which modern \acp{crs} are built. This section provides an overview of the primary classifications of recommendation models and the standard methodologies used for their evaluation.
