The complexity of building applications on top of \acp{llm} has led to the development of powerful orchestration frameworks. These frameworks provide abstractions that simplify common tasks such as managing prompts, connecting to data sources, and chaining together multiple \ac{llm} calls and tool invocations. Some of most the dominant open-source frameworks in this space are \texttt{LangChain} \cite{LANGCHAIN}, \texttt{LlamaIndex} \cite{LLAMAINDEX} and \texttt{Haystack} \cite{HAYSTACK}.

While all three serve a similar purpose, they have different core philosophies. \texttt{LangChain} is a general-purpose framework designed for maximum flexibility in creating complex, custom agentic workflows. \texttt{LlamaIndex}, conversely, is a data-centric framework that specializes in the \ac{rag} pipeline, offering a rich set of tools for data ingestion, indexing, and retrieval. \texttt{Haystack} is geared towards building production-ready, scalable search agents, with an explicit focus on deployable pipelines. Ultimately, this project leverages \texttt{LlamaIndex} for its state-of-the-art, data-centric capabilities.
