This chapter presents the empirical evaluation of the Hybrid \acl{crs}. The primary goal of the experiments is to validate the methodologies proposed in the previous chapter and to answer the core research questions concerning user profiling, recommendation quality, and explainability. The chapter begins by detailing the experimental environment and the datasets used for the evaluation. It then describes the specific experimental procedures, with a strong focus on the usability testing conducted with human participants. Finally, it presents and analyzes the results obtained from these experiments, providing both quantitative and qualitative insights into the platform's performance and user perception.
