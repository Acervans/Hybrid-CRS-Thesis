This section presents the analysis of the data collected from the usability study described in the previous chapter. The results are organized into three main parts. First, an overview of the platform's general usability is presented, including the System Usability Scale score and overall user ratings. This is followed by a qualitative analysis of user satisfaction and the constructive feedback gathered. Finally, a quantitative comparison of the perceived quality of recommendations and explanations between the initial (cold-start) and post-retraining conversational scenarios is detailed.
