The overall usability of the \texttt{HybridCRS} platform was measured using the \ac{sus} questionnaire and a general rating scale. The platform achieved a final \ac{sus} score of \textbf{92 out of 100}, with a standard deviation of 4.76. This score is well above the average of 68 and falls into the highest percentile, indicating an excellent level of perceived usability. The detailed breakdown of the average scores for each of the ten \acs{sus} questions is visualized in Figure~\ref{FIG:SUS_RESULTS}.

This strong result was reinforced by the participants' general rating of the platform, which received an average score of \textbf{9.36 out of 10} (standard deviation of 0.81). This suggests a consistent and highly positive user experience across the participant group. While the overall usability was rated highly, the individual \acs{sus} question scores indicate that some participants felt they might need some initial assistance or time to learn the more complex functionalities, such as the agent creation wizard.
