All experiments and evaluations described in this chapter were conducted on a single machine with the following hardware specifications, representing a typical modern developer-grade laptop:

\begin{compactitem}[\textbullet]
    \item \textbf{\acs{cpu}:} Intel® Core™ i7-11800H @ 2.30 GHz (16 Cores)
    \item \textbf{\acs{ram}:} 16 GB DDR4 @ 3200MHz
    \item \textbf{\acs{gpu}:} NVIDIA® GeForce® RTX 3050 Laptop \acs{gpu} with 4GB of VRAM
\end{compactitem}

The software environment was managed entirely through Docker Compose. The setup included a containerized Ollama service for hosting the \ac{llm}, a FalkorDB database, and a FastAPI backend. For the performance tests detailed in the complementary thesis \cite{MUII-THESIS}, the backend was configured to run with 4 workers to fully utilize the hardware; however, for the experiments interacting with real users, it was run with a single worker to accurately reflect the production deployment constraint.
