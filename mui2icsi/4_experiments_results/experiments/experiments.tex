To evaluate the implemented system and address the research questions, a user-centric experimental methodology was designed. As the research focuses on the quality of the human-computer interaction, a comprehensive usability study was conducted with human participants. This approach allows for the collection of both quantitative and qualitative data regarding the platform's performance from the user's perspective. These tests were carried out on the \texttt{HybridCRS} web platform, a modern, responsive application for creating and chatting with recommender agents, developed for the complementary engineering thesis \cite{MUII_THESIS}. The following subsections detail the usability testing protocol and the specific criteria used to evaluate the quality of the recommendations and their explanations.
