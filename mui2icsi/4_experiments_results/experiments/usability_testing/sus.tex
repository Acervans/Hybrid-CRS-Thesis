The \acl{sus} is a standardized and widely validated tool for measuring perceived usability. It consists of a 10-item questionnaire with five response options, ranging from ``Strongly Disagree'' to ``Strongly Agree''. After completing all three guided tasks, participants were asked to fill out the \acs{sus} questionnaire. The final score, ranging from 0 to 100, is calculated using the standard formula, where odd-numbered questions represent positive statements and even-numbered questions represent negative statements.

\begin{equation}[EQ:SUS_SCORE]{SUS Score Calculation}
    SUS = 2.5 \times \left( \sum_{i \in \{1,3,5,7,9\}} (score_i - 1) + \sum_{j \in \{2,4,6,8,10\}} (5 - score_j) \right)
