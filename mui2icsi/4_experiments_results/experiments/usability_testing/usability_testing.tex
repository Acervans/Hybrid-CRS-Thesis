Usability testing was carried out to evaluate the \texttt{HybridCRS} platform's user experience, focusing on its usability and overall performance. The testing involved a group of participants who interacted with the system, providing feedback on various aspects such as recommendation quality, usability, and design. The \acl{sus} \cite{SUS} was employed to quantify the usability of the platform, a ten-item attitude Likert scale giving a global view of subjective assessments of usability. The complete questionnaire used for these tests is included in Appendix~\ref{AP:HYBRIDCRS_QUESTIONNAIRE}.

\paragraph{Participant Demographics}
A total of 11 participants took part in the usability testing study. The participants were between 23 and 24 years old, with an average age of approximately 23.5 years. The group consisted of 10 male participants and one female participant. Most participants reported having prior experience with \acp{llm} and chatbots: 10 of the 11 had experience with \acs{llm} chat interfaces, and all 11 had experience using chatbots. This sample reflects a relatively homogeneous group in terms of age and high technological familiarity.
