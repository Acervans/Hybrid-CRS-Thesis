The quality of the recommendations generated by the system was evaluated qualitatively as part of the user study. After completing the conversational tasks (Use Cases 2 and 3), participants were asked to rate the recommendations they received on a 10-point scale across four distinct criteria:

\begin{compactitem}[\textbullet]
    \item \textbf{Accuracy:} The general relevance and appeal of the recommended items to the user.
    \item \textbf{Contextual Relevance:} How well the recommendations matched the specific preferences and constraints stated during the conversation.
    \item \textbf{Novelty:} The degree to which the recommendations were new, unusual, or not simply popular, mainstream items.
    \item \textbf{Diversity:} The variety of the recommended items in terms of their attributes (e.g., genre).
