To evaluate the system on a larger scale, an \textbf{Anime} dataset containing user preference data from the anime tracking website \url{https://myanimelist.net} was used. This dataset is significantly larger and sparser than MovieLens-100k, providing a different set of challenges for the recommendation and conversational agents.

It contains over 7.8 million ratings from tens of thousands of users on 12,294 unique anime titles. Unlike MovieLens, it does not contain user-specific metadata. However, it provides a rich set of item features, including the anime's name, genres, type (e.g., TV, movie), number of episodes, overall average rating, and the number of users who have it on their list (a measure of popularity). This feature set is ideal for testing the system's ability to handle content-based and contextual recommendations within a large item catalog.
