The \textbf{MovieLens-100k} dataset is a classic benchmark for evaluating recommendation algorithms, collected by the GroupLens Research group. It was selected for this study due to its manageable size for rapid testing and its rich feature set, which is well-suited for evaluating preference elicitation and explanation generation.

The dataset consists of 100,000 ratings (from 1 to 5) from 943 users on 1,682 movies. In addition to the interaction data, it provides metadata for both users (age, gender, occupation) and items (movie title, release year, and genres). The dataset is notably sparse, with over 93\% of possible user-item interactions being absent, which makes it a realistic test case for recommendation challenges like the cold-start problem.
